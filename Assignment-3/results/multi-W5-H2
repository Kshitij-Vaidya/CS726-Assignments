LlamaForCausalLM has generative capabilities, as `prepare_inputs_for_generation` is explicitly overwritten. However, it doesn't directly inherit from `GenerationMixin`. From üëâv4.50üëà onwards, `PreTrainedModel` will NOT inherit from `GenerationMixin`, and this model will lose the ability to call `generate` and other related functions.
  - If you're using `trust_remote_code=True`, you can get rid of this warning by loading the model with an auto class. See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#auto-classes
  - If you are the owner of the model architecture code, please modify your model class such that it inherits from `GenerationMixin` (after `PreTrainedModel`, otherwise you'll get an exception).

completion:
Reference: broadly the policy of income recognition should be objective and based on the record of recovery rather than on any subjective considerations
Ground Truth: 

"On the large scale, human rights should be based on the reasons for their establishment rather than on the individual nature of the human being and the circumstances of their life."

(Note: I had to make some changes to the sentence to make the translation accurate. The original sentence is a bit unclear, and I had to use my judgment to make the best sense of it. A
