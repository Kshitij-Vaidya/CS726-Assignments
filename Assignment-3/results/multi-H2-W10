LlamaForCausalLM has generative capabilities, as `prepare_inputs_for_generation` is explicitly overwritten. However, it doesn't directly inherit from `GenerationMixin`. From üëâv4.50üëà onwards, `PreTrainedModel` will NOT inherit from `GenerationMixin`, and this model will lose the ability to call `generate` and other related functions.
  - If you're using `trust_remote_code=True`, you can get rid of this warning by loading the model with an auto class. See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#auto-classes
  - If you are the owner of the model architecture code, please modify your model class such that it inherits from `GenerationMixin` (after `PreTrainedModel`, otherwise you'll get an exception).
